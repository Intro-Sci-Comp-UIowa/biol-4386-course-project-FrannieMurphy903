This directory contains the results of measuring the cells in the images in the "data" directory. The directory is first divided into subfolders for each of the six measurment parameters: area, perimeter, major diameter, minor diameter, circularity, and aspect ratio/elongation. These folders are then further subdivided by time point. Each time point folder contains 20 csv files each containing the values for each cell in one of the 20 images taken at that point in the time course experiment.
